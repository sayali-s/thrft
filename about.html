            <p> THRFT is our little space to share tips, trick and hacks for a more sustainable life. This is
                our
                way of driving change in a world that is facing the daunting task of tackling both climate change and
                unprecedented biodiversity loss. Weâ€™re wild for wild places and we want to contribute to the
                preservation
                and
                protection of these precious things.</p>

            <p> We hope to inspire others to find value in nature, to live more sustainably and with purpose.</p>

            <p>What underpins US is the belief that we all have enormous power to positively shape our
                environment through the ideas, organizations, and people we choose to support.</p>

            <p>We focus on supporting changemakers (both individuals and businesses) that are making a meaningful
                difference
                to
                the world around them.</p>

            <p>Our readers want to learn about and live a more deliberate, purposeful and conscious life. We showcase
                all
                things sustainable and ethical, from travel and lifestyle to beauty and fashion. </p>
