            <p>Today, professional woman are savvier than ever and not only pay attention to the quality
                of their garments, but also the entire supply chain, production processes, and product afterlife. They
                are
                more aware that a hang tag using the word “sustainable” does not mean the retailer is using clean
                processes
                to develop that garment.</p>
            <p>One of the biggest culprits in the fashion industry is “fast fashion,” or clothes made
                cheaply to meet demands for the hot new styles. However, fast fashion is putting our future planet at
                risk.
            </p>

            <p> After nearly 25 years in the industry, Melissa Nataadiningrat has over a dozen patents
                and
                immense product successes under her name, not to mention her extensive knowledge on sustainable fashion.
            </p>

            <p>We have to understand that a supply chain is its own ecosystem that must be sustained and
                supported
                indefinitely in order for the world to see true environmental impact. We must design, develop, and
                manufacture into that premise.”
            <p> Are all fabrics created the same? Are they: </p>
            <p> Made to last? </p>
            <p>Limiting the amount of wasted fabric in production?</p>
            <p>Aware of the environmental impact from fabric production?</p>
            Professional woman are catching on to the new trends in textiles and technology. They are choosing
            garments
            and materials engineered to last longer. Some of the most sustainable materials are natural fibers
            (cotton,
            hemp, linen) and futuristic/innovative fabrics. They are ditching cheap synthetics (polyester, nylon,
            spandex). These fibers are not grown naturally, and instead come from chemicals and polymers.

            We all love those quick-drying polyester tanks and tees because they are cheap, wrinkle-free, and
            readily
            available. But they hold on to bacteria and will stink so fast you'll be inclined to throw them away
            after
            just a few post-work SoulCycle classes. What you don't realize is that it can take up to 200 years for
            that
            garment to decompose. Using cutting-edge technology to create the fabric of the future, companies are
            paying
            closer attention to creating cleaner garments.</p>
